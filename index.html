                <h2>A Little About me</h2>
                
                <p>Hello there! I am a <em>Computer Engineering</em> student at <em>UCSD</em> with an expected graduation of 2024. My passion for coding drives me to continuously improve my skills and 
                    find new and innovative ways to bring my ideas to life. My ultimate goal is to work for a leading technology company as a software engineer, where I can leverage my coding skills to 
                    create products that positively impact people's lives. I am deeply invested in developing solutions that solve real-world problems and have meaningful impact on society.
                    I have had experiences with working as a <em>student intern</em> for a research lab at <em>UCLA</em>, where I created an AI module to help elementary school students learn.
                    <br><br>Aside from being a coding enthusiast, I am a proud member of <em>Phi Gamma Delta</em> fraternity. As a <em>community service leader</em> within the fraternity, I am committed to giving back to society by organizing events
                    and initiatives that benefit those in need. When I'm not coding, I enjoy a healthy lifestyle through working out, playing soccer, and occasionally playing video games with my friends.
                    I also cherish the time I spend with friends and making memories with them at music festivals.

                    <h3>June 2019 to August 2019</h3>
                    <p>I managed a group of high school and undergraduate students in producing a module talking about artificial intelligence. Our objective as a team was to focus specifically at computer vision and how AI is used to 
                        develop autonomous driving. The task was to break down the complex topic so that even elementary school students can comprehend the material. In addition to the module, I had to transcribed the professor's lecture notes using LaTeX.

                        <th><p>I led a team of 6 members in an <i>Agile</i> software process to develop an <em>Android</em> app that generates a step-by-step guide for users to navigate their trip at the San Diego Zoo.
                        I had apply Behavior-Driven development to meet with the client's user stories. I was in charge of coordinating the team's weekly stand up meetings through our three-weeks sprints.
                        Additionally, I had to apply multiple design patterns: Strategy, Adapter, Observer, and Model-View-Presenter to accelerate the development process. JUnit and object mocking were used to increase test coverage and the 
                        performance of the mobile application by 80% speed.

                            In this personal project, I wanted to create a basic workout planner where users are able to input their daily workouts and track their progression in the gym. In this dynamic page, all the datas 
                            are stored in local storage. The goal of implementing this basic web application was to explore HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                            I integrated an API of a graph as a tool to find transmission clusters and help prevent the spread of a virus. The application utilizes a variety of algorithms such as Djkstra's, Kruskal's, and BFS to traverse between
                            nodes to find the shortest path given to a certain threshold. This application was developed using C++ and utilized a variety of data structures such as priority queues, custom comparators, disjoint sets, and map.
